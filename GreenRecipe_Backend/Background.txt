How to build a Docker-Compose file?
It is a tool for defining and running multi-container docker applications.
You would want to use it in cases where you require more than one instance of the container.

Docker Compoase builds a stack of applications to run a complete service.
For instance, we can have two applications called web and db which handles the web server part of the application and database server part of the application.

If the web section requires more specific requirements that definition can be offloaded onto a Dockerfile.

version: 8

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
   
  db:
    image:mysql
    ports:
    - "3306:3306:
    environment:
    - MYSQL_PAAM=value
    ...
    
Working with Dockerfile
ADD- copies files from the host to the destination location in the container.
CMD- execute a command in the container
ENTRYPOINT- sets as a default application be used everytime a container is created using this image.
ENV- sets environmanet variables.
EXPOSE- exposes the specified ports from the container.
FROM- defines the base image to start the build process.
MAINTAINER- defines a full name and email address of the image creator.
RUN- central executing directive for Dockerfiles.
USER- sets tthe UID or username whcih is to run the container
VOLUME- is used to enable access from the container to the location on the host machine.
WORKDIR- sets the path where the command defined in the CMD is to be executed.

docker-compose references.
context: path to a directory containing Dockerfile or url to a git repo.
dockerfile: alternate docker file.
args: adds build arguements which are only accessible during the build process.
